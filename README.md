I think we will have an extra supervision class to go through the
rabbit-sheep example in slower detail.  The following
[Rmd file](de/sheep-phaseR.Rmd) and
[example](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sje30/rpc2016/master/de/sheep-phaseR.html)
The
[R journal article](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2014-2/grayling.pdf)
will also be useful reading.
